# Hi! I'm @ericmqt

I've been a professional software developer for over ten years, working mostly with C#/.NET. I've been programming since I was 12, having
self-taught up through college before I dropped out to work for a major tech company--programming is my passion in life and always has been.
I am intensely self-motivated, voraciously learning anything and everything that I can.

These days, I am the Senior Software Engineer for a small software company I helped co-found, currently designing and developing our next-generation product.
